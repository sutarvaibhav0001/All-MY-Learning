    "**Answer (2-min):**\n",
    "Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can autonomously plan, reason, use tools, and execute multi-step tasks to achieve a specific goal. Unlike traditional LLMs that only generate text, Agentic AI can decide what action to take next, call external tools like APIs or databases, observe results, and iterate until the task is completed.\n",
