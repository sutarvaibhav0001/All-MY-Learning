    "## 🧠 **Bag of Words (BoW) – Full Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag of Words (BoW)** is a simple and commonly used **text representation technique** in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.\n",
    "It represents text (sentences or documents) as a **set (bag)** of words **without considering grammar or word order**, but keeping **word frequency** in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Treat each unique word in the text corpus as a **feature**.\n",
    "* Count how many times each word appears in each document.\n",
    "* Represent each document as a **vector of word counts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Input Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Document 1: \"I love NLP\"\n",
    "Document 2: \"I love Machine Learning\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Create Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "All unique words:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"I\", \"love\", \"NLP\", \"Machine\", \"Learning\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Vector Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "| Document | I | love | NLP | Machine | Learning |\n",
    "| -------- | - | ---- | --- | ------- | -------- |\n",
    "| Doc 1    | 1 | 1    | 1   | 0       | 0        |\n",
    "| Doc 2    | 1 | 1    | 0   | 1       | 1        |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each document is now represented as a **numerical vector**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Doc1 → [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "* Doc2 → [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **How It Works in Python (Example Code)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample text\n",
    "documents = [\"I love NLP\", \"I love Machine Learning\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the BoW model\n",
    "vectorizer = CountVectorizer()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit and transform the data\n",
    "X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the vocabulary\n",
    "print(\"Vocabulary:\", vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the BoW representation\n",
    "print(\"BoW Array:\\n\", X.toarray())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Vocabulary: ['learning', 'love', 'machine', 'nlp']\n",
    "BoW Array:\n",
    "[[0 1 0 1]\n",
    " [1 1 1 0]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Types of Bag of Words Representations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Count Vectorization (Basic)**\n",
    "   → Stores word frequency counts.\n",
    "2. **Binary Representation**\n",
    "   → Stores only presence (1) or absence (0) of words.\n",
    "3. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**\n",
    "   → Weighted BoW that reduces the influence of common words like “the”, “is”.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Simple to understand and implement\n",
    "✅ Works well for small and medium-sized datasets\n",
    "✅ Good baseline model for text classification tasks\n",
    "✅ Converts unstructured text into numerical data usable by ML algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Disadvantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Ignores **word order** and **context**\n",
    "❌ Produces **high-dimensional sparse vectors** for large corpora\n",
    "❌ Doesn’t understand **semantics** (meaning of words)\n",
    "❌ Doesn’t handle **synonyms** (e.g., “good” and “nice” treated differently)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text Classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis)\n",
    "* Document Similarity\n",
    "* Information Retrieval\n",
    "* Topic Modeling\n",
