    "## 📘 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** is a statistical measure used in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Retrieval (IR)** to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "It combines **Term Frequency (TF)** and **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** to give a weight to each word.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "TF measures how frequently a term (word) occurs in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Formula:\n",

    "### 🔹 Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF measures how **important** a term is — i.e., how rare or common it is across all documents.\n",
