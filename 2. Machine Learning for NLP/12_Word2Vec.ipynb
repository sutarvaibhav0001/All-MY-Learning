    "# 🧠 **Word2Vec – Full Notes with Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word2Vec** is a **word embedding technique** developed by **Tomas Mikolov and team at Google (2013)**.\n",
    "It represents **words as dense vectors** (numerical form) such that **similar words are close together** in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧩 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* “King” – [0.21, 0.98, -0.55, 0.33, …]\n",
    "* “Queen” – [0.19, 0.89, -0.49, 0.29, …]\n",
    "* “Apple” – [0.75, 0.12, 0.56, 0.02, …]\n",
    "\n",
    "📍These numbers don’t have direct meaning individually, but together they capture **semantic relationships** between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **2. Why Word2Vec?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Word2Vec, methods like **One-Hot Encoding** or **Bag of Words (BoW)** had limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method           | Limitation                                           |\n",
    "| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| One-Hot Encoding | Large, sparse vectors; no relationship between words |\n",
    "| Bag of Words     | Ignores context; cannot capture meaning or order     |\n",
    "| TF-IDF           | Focuses on word frequency, not semantic meaning      |\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Word2Vec overcomes these** by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Producing **dense and low-dimensional** vectors\n",
    "* Capturing **semantic similarity**\n",
    "* Preserving **contextual meaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **3. Core Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is based on the **distributional hypothesis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Words that appear in similar contexts have similar meanings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "“The cat sat on the mat.”\n",
    "“The dog sat on the rug.”\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ “Cat” and “Dog” appear in similar contexts → similar embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **4. Word2Vec Architectures**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two main architectures**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 (A) Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicts **target word** based on **context words**.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "  Input: [“the”, “cat”, “on”, “the”, “mat”]\n",
    "  Target: “sat”\n",
    "  Model learns: context → word\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 It averages the context embeddings and predicts the middle word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 (B) Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicts **context words** based on **target word**.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "  Input: “sat”\n",
    "  Output: [“the”, “cat”, “on”, “the”, “mat”]\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Works well for small datasets and captures **rare word relationships** better.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature        | CBOW                | Skip-Gram           |\n",
    "| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |\n",
    "| Predicts       | Target from context | Context from target |\n",
    "| Training speed | Faster              | Slower              |\n",
    "| Good for       | Frequent words      | Rare words          |\n",
    "| Accuracy       | Lower               | Higher              |\n",
