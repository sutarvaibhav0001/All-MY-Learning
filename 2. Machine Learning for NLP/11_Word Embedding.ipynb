    "## 🧠 **Word Embeddings — Full Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Embedding** is a technique in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to represent words as **dense vectors of real numbers** in a continuous vector space.\n",
    "It captures the **semantic meaning**, **relationships**, and **context** of words better than traditional methods like One-Hot Encoding or Bag of Words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Words with **similar meanings** have **similar vector representations**.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “King” – “Man” + “Woman” ≈ “Queen”\n",
    "\n",
    "So, embeddings help machines **understand semantic relationships** among words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each word is represented as a **vector** (say, of 100 or 300 dimensions).\n",
    "* These vectors are **learned from large text corpora** using models like **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, or **FastText**.\n",
    "* The position of a word vector in the space is such that **similar words are close** to each other (based on cosine similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 **Types of Word Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Word2Vec (by Google, 2013)**\n",
    "\n",
    "It learns embeddings using a neural network model with two main architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### a) **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicts a **word** given its **context** (surrounding words).\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "  Context: “I ___ NLP” → Predict: “love”\n",
    "\n",
    "##### b) **Skip-Gram**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicts **context words** from a **target word**.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "  Target: “love” → Predict: “I”, “NLP”\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 **Use Case:** Works well for large datasets, captures semantic and syntactic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation, by Stanford)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on **word co-occurrence statistics** from a corpus.\n",
    "* Focuses on **global** statistical information (unlike Word2Vec which is local).\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 **Use Case:** Captures global relationships; good for semantic analogy tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **FastText (by Facebook)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represents each word as a **bag of character n-grams**.\n",
    "* Useful for **morphologically rich languages** or **rare/out-of-vocabulary (OOV)** words.\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 **Use Case:** Can infer embeddings for unseen words by using subword information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
