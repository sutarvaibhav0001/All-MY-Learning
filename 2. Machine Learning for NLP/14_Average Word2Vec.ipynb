    "# 🧠 **Average Word2Vec – Full Notes with Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word2Vec** is a powerful word embedding technique that represents words as numerical vectors.\n",
    "However, in many NLP tasks, we need to represent **an entire sentence or document** as a single vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Average Word2Vec** is a simple and effective method to do this.\n",
    "It works by **averaging the Word2Vec vectors of all words** in the sentence/document.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Why Average Word2Vec?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Word2Vec gives embeddings **only for individual words**.\n",
    "* Many tasks (like sentiment analysis, document classification, etc.) need **sentence-level or document-level representation**.\n",
    "* Instead of complex architectures, we can just take the **average of word embeddings** to represent the full text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say a sentence has ( n ) words:\n",
    "[\n",
    "S = [w_1, w_2, w_3, \\ldots, w_n]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word ( w_i ) has a Word2Vec embedding ( v_i ) of dimension ( d ).\n",
    "Then the **Average Word2Vec vector** of the sentence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "V_{avg} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "This ( V_{avg} ) is now the **sentence embedding**.\n",
