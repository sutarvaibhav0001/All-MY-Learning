    "\n",
    "## 🧠 **Word2Vec — Skip-Gram Model (Full Notes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word2Vec** is a technique in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to represent words as numerical vectors (called *word embeddings*), capturing **semantic relationships** between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was introduced by **Tomas Mikolov et al. (Google, 2013)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec has two main architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**\n",
    "   → Predicts *target word* from *context words*.\n",
    "2. **Skip-Gram**\n",
    "   → Predicts *context words* from a *target word*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. What is Skip-Gram?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Skip-Gram model** works **opposite to CBOW**.\n",
    "Given a *center word*, it tries to **predict the surrounding context words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “I love natural language processing”\n",
    "\n",
    "If the **window size = 2**, then for each target word:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Target (Input Word) | Context Words (Output) |\n",
    "| ------------------- | ---------------------- |\n",
    "| I                   | love                   |\n",
    "| love                | I, natural             |\n",
    "| natural             | love, language         |\n",
    "| language            | natural, processing    |\n",
    "| processing          | language               |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, **“love”** is the *center word*, and **“I”** and **“natural”** are its *context words*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 3. Objective of Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Gram tries to **maximize the probability** of predicting context words given a target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "J = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\sum_{-c \\leq j \\leq c, j \\neq 0} \\log P(w_{t+j} | w_t)\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ( T ) → total number of words in corpus\n",
    "* ( c ) → context window size\n",
    "* ( w_t ) → target word at position *t*\n",
    "* ( w_{t+j} ) → context word\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal:\n",
    "👉 Find word vectors that make nearby words have high probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 4. How Skip-Gram Works (Step-by-Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Input Word\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one word (the target word) from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Generate Training Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "For each target word, pair it with its context words (within the window size).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example sentence: “The dog barked loudly”\n",
    "If window size = 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input  | Output      |\n",
    "| ------ | ----------- |\n",
    "| dog    | The, barked |\n",
    "| barked | dog, loudly |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Neural Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a **simple 3-layer neural network**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input layer:** One-hot vector of target word\n",
    "2. **Hidden layer:** Dense representation (word embedding)\n",
    "3. **Output layer:** Softmax layer over all words in vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagram (conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input word → Hidden Layer → Output Layer\n",
    "   (one-hot)     (embedding)    (softmax probabilities)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Training\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model adjusts word vectors to increase the probability of correct context words.\n",
    "* **Loss function:** Cross-entropy between predicted and actual context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 5. Probability Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each target-context pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "P(w_O | w_I) = \\frac{\\exp(v'*{w_O} \\cdot v*{w_I})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V} \\exp(v'*w \\cdot v*{w_I})}\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ( v_{w_I} ): input (target) word vector\n",
    "* ( v'_{w_O} ): output (context) word vector\n",
    "* ( V ): size of vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 6. Optimization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "To make training efficient for large vocabularies, two techniques are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Negative Sampling:**\n",
    "   Instead of updating weights for all words, update only a few “negative” (random) words along with positive examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Softmax:**\n",
    "   Uses a binary tree structure to reduce computation cost of softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 7. Example (Simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a small corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “I love dogs”\n",
    "\n",
    "Vocabulary: [I, love, dogs]\n",
    "Window size = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input (Target) | Output (Context) |\n",
    "| -------------- | ---------------- |\n",
    "| I              | love             |\n",
    "| love           | I, dogs          |\n",
    "| dogs           | love             |\n",
    "\n",
    "During training:\n",
    "\n",
    "* “love” vector gets close to both “I” and “dogs”\n",
    "* “I” and “dogs” get indirectly connected through “love”\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 After training, the **word embeddings** show **semantic similarity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cosine_similarity(love, dogs) ≈ cosine_similarity(love, I)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🔹 8. Skip-Gram vs CBOW (Comparison Table)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
